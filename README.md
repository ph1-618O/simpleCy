# simpleCy
This program creates a simple caesar cipher from an input to code and offers an option to decode. Both functions require knowledge of the shift amount. A Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by 'N' value left for negative values, and right for positive values with the periphery letters rotating respectively. The technique is named after Julius Caesar due to its use in his private correspondence. This cipher is not recommended for use in security applications.
